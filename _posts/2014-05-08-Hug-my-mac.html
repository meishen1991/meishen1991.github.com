title: Hug My First Mac!!!!
---
<p> I got my first mac in my life yesterday!!! In order to be a independent app developer, I will start from iOS app. Before this, I have made some web sites and two chrome apps, one extension, but it is a whole new thing for me to develop a iOS app~ And I need to learn the Object-C from nothing!! I feel so excited that I finally make the first move for my Mac-life. </p>

<p>After graduated from THU for nearly one year, I learn to consider a product from a product manager's view, and try to learn the skills to improve my consciousness of the overall situation. Besides, I keep practicing my FE skills to make sure I will have a good foundation to face the change of the world...(I believe that web app will terminate the client app)~~</p> 

<p>For next month, I will resign from current company. And I will back home to get a three-month-military-training. I choose this to make me stronger and slimmer~~</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I will prepare the application for next year and hope I can get a satisfied result~ My beloved CMU!!!<p>
