title: About the Summary Plan
---

<p>I fail to insist the Summary Plan on my last wordpress blog, So I hope in the github page, I can repick the plan and keep it until I land on the United States.</p>
<h3>What does the plan mainly talk about?</h3>
    <li>To make my english better, I want to learn writing and reading by summarizing beautiful aricles I read from my feeds;</li>
<h3>How about the updates?</h3>
    <li>At first, based on the experience from last failure and patch plan, I plan to update the post every three day in average.</li>
<h3>Where the articles from?</h3>
    <li>Basically, all source materials come from my subscriptions, and I use my little tool: <a href="http://zzgary.info/djangoblog/newp/feedpusher" target="_blank">feedpusher</a> to collect and read them.</li>
