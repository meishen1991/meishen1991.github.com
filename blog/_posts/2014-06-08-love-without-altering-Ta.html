title: Love without altering him/her!!!!
---

If you loved me, you wouldn't want to change me. The impulse to alter out lovers appears to run counter to the spirit of love. If we loved and were loved, surely there wouldn't be any talk of change? Isn't love about the acceptance of an entire being, in their hgih and low points?
<br>
The idea of wanting to change our partners sounds incongrous and disturbing because, collectively, we have been deeply influenced by a Romantic conception of love. This states that the principle marker of love is the capacity to accept another person in their totality, in all their good and bad sides - and in a sense, particularly their bad sides. To love someone is, quite simply, according to Romantic philosophy, to love them as they are - without any wish to alter them. We must embrace the whole person to be worthy of the emotion we claim to feel.
<br>

The Greeks took the view that love is not an obscure emotion. To love someone is not an odd chemical phenomenon indescribable in words. It just means being awed by another person for all the sort of things about them that truly are right and accomplished. (PS. That's the reason why people say: people in love are blindness.)
<br>

The Greek idea of love turns to a notion to which we desperately need to rehabilitate ouselves: education. For the Greeks, given that we are all imperfect, part of what it means to deepen love is to want to teach - and to be taught. Two people should see a relationship as a constant opportunity to improve and be improved. When lovers teach each other uncomfortable truths, they are not giving up on love. They are trying to do something very true to love: which is to make their partners more loveable.
<br>

We should stop feeling guilty for simply wanting to change out partners, and we should never resent out partners for simply wanting to change us. Both these projects are, in theory, highly legitimate, even necessary. They desire to put one's lover right is, in fact, utterly loyal to the essential task of love - to help another person to become the best version of themselves.

First I thought this is an article which told people not to alter their love partners. Kind of like if you loved someone, love her/his dog and everythings... But when I finish my reading, I realize that what the aiticle really means is we should be willing to be changed to some better level. We should believe that the relationship will improve both of us in many ways. And to be a good student, we should not reject the help of others, they can point out the weakness of you. So be open minded, listen carefully and humbly accept others' advice.
