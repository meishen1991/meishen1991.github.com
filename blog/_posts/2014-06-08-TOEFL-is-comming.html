title: Toefl is comming!!!!
---
About 10 days ago, I finished my IETLS exam. And yesterday I got the grades, enough to take the working holiday visa of New Zealand, but not enough to reach my expectation. I am really good at reading part, whose grade is 8.5, but the rest is really awful... And for writing, I only got 5... It really make me upset... And for the comming Toefl exam, I need a emergency training for the weak parts.
<br>

Firstly, I will make one post at least per day. And most posts will base on one or two articles I read on the internet. I will summarize the article and add some comments of myself. Meantime, I will use the Umano to practice my listening and speaking.
<br>

Secondly, I will broad my topics, and as close as possible to the Toefl.
<br>

Yeah, I have nearly 13 days left, and God bless me!
