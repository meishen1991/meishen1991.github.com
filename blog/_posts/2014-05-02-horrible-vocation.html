title: Boring and Tiring Vocation...
---

<p>With the "International labor day" around the corner, my roommates left the house one by one. On the afternoon of the first day, I am the only guy in this three bedroom house... What's bitter? I have to stay for preparing my english exam for nex-x-x-t-week. </p>
<p>At first, because the internet was expired in the end of April, so I hope I would get a non-disturbed vocation and focus on my English exam. But, one of my roommate was so kind that she renewed the internet before she left...</p>
<p>Last new year holiday, I told my parents that I had been one of the "netizen", and internet became the base of my Maslow's hierarchy of needs. I even cannot imagine what the life would be without the internet... Beacuse even I hitchhike on the Tibet, I can access internet through my mobile phone... </p>

<p>Now two days past... Look what i have done:
<ul>
    <li>Fix the feedpusher for some bugs;</li>
    <li>Build my Github pages and jekyll workflow;</li>
    <li>Read several articles about the ux;</li>
    <li>Finish nearly 2 seasons, 44 episodes, of "How I met Your mother";</li>
    <li>Recite and review GRE words -- total: 2429;</li>
</ul>
And things I haven't done:
<ul>
    <li>Merge the common components In different versions of feedpusher into some common files;</li>
    <li>The rest words of GRE --- total: 3714l</li>
    <li>GUI Bloopers -- 100 pages</li>
    <li>Finish my feeds;</li>
</ul>

So , now I have 2 days left, hope I can finish all these on time...
